# AWS Regions and AZs

## Regions
* Regions exist all around the world. Each region is a set of datacenters.
* Most services are scoped within a region. Meaning if you use the same service in a different region, your
data will not carry over.

## Availability Zones
* Each region has 2, 3 or more AZ within it.
* An AZ is a discrete data center, with redundant power, networking and connectivity.
* AZ are isolated from each other for disasters, but are connected over networks.

Some services are Global, like IAM and S3.
